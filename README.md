# üí° My AWS re/Start Journey: From Ambition to Architecture

Welcome to my cloud playground! This repository is more than just code; it's a testament to my **12-week intensive transformation** through the **AWS re/Start program**. Having dedicated myself to mastering the fundamentals of cloud computing, networking, and security, I have emerged as an **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** ready to innovate and solve real-world challenges.

My journey taught me how to move beyond theoretical knowledge and apply **hands-on problem-solving** using core AWS services. I thrive in collaborative environments and I am committed to **continuous learning** in the ever-evolving world of cloud technology.

## üåü Core Competencies & Key Achievements

The AWS re/Start program is a rigorous, performance-based curriculum. I successfully navigated challenges that honed the following critical skills:

### ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Cloud Proficiency

* **Compute:** Launched, configured, and managed **EC2 instances**, utilizing **Auto Scaling Groups** for high availability and serverless **Lambda** functions for event-driven tasks.
* **Networking:** Mastered **VPC architecture**, including subnetting, routing tables, NAT gateways, **Security Groups**, and NACLs to build secure, isolated environments.
* **Storage:** Implemented **S3** solutions for durable object storage, configured lifecycle policies, and managed various **EBS** volumes and snapshots.
* **Databases:** Provisioned and managed relational databases (**PostgreSQL**) using **Amazon RDS** and explored NoSQL solutions with **DynamoDB**, enhanced with caching via DAX and ElastiCache.
* **Security & Monitoring:** Configured **IAM** roles and policies, and utilized **CloudWatch** and **Trusted Advisor** for robust monitoring, logging, and best-practice recommendations.

### üíª Technical Skills & Tools

* **Languages & Scripting:** Proficient in **Python** and **Bash scripting** for automation tasks.
* **IaC (Infrastructure as Code):** Experienced in writing, validating, and deploying infrastructure via AWS **CloudFormation** templates (YAML/JSON).
* **Operating Systems:** High proficiency in **Linux CLI** commands and systems administration basics.
* **Version Control:** **Git & GitHub** for collaborative development and source control.

## üìÇ Featured Projects

Explore the links below to see my skills applied in action through comprehensive, simulated projects:

### 1. The 3D E-Commerce Store Architecture

**Description:** This project involved designing and architecting a next-generation 3D e-commerce platform that serves millions of global users. It demonstrates a deep understanding of multi-AZ deployments, automatic failover, edge caching, serverless components, and security best practices to achieve **high availability, scalability, performance, and cost optimization.**

**Key Architectural Components:**
| Component Type | AWS Services Used | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Entry & Global Distribution** | Amazon Route 53, Amazon CloudFront (with AWS WAF) | DNS resolution, global content delivery, and edge security. |
| **Authentication & API Routing** | Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Cognito | Secure front door for backend APIs and user authentication. |
| **Backend Processing & Compute** | AWS Lambda, Amazon EC2 (Auto Scaling Group), Application Load Balancer (ALB) | Hybrid serverless and scalable EC2 compute model. |
| **Data Storage & Caching** | Amazon DynamoDB (with DAX), Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL), Amazon ElastiCache | Low-latency dynamic data, relational data, and session caching. |
| **Networking & Security** | Amazon VPC, IAM Roles & Security Groups | Resource isolation, network segmentation, and least-privilege security model. |
| **Monitoring & Optimization** | Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Trusted Advisor | Collecting metrics/logs and providing best-practice recommendations. |



### 2. AWS SimuLearn: Core Security Concepts

**Description:** This hands-on lab and simulation challenged me to apply **core security principles** directly in the AWS Console, specifically focusing on Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices for organizational users.

‚≠ê **Key Security Concepts Applied**
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Designing **IAM policies** that grant only the necessary permissions to perform a specific job function.
* **IAM Users and Groups:** Creating a dedicated **IAM Group** for the support engineers and assigning the necessary permissions to the group, ensuring centralized management.
* **AWS Managed Policies:** Utilizing a common AWS managed policy, such as `ReadOnlyAccess`, to grant safe access to AWS services like Amazon EC2.
* **Security Policy Implementation:** Understanding the structure and effect of IAM Policies to control access to specific resources (e.g., granting read-only permissions to all EC2 instances).
