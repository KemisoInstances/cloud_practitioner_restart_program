# Cloud ComputingðŸ¤«ðŸ¤«

## What is Cloud Computing
* Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
* A cloud services platform such as Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing
* Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go/Pay for what you use
* Elasticity: the ability to scale out and scale in when needed
* Agility: rapidly develop, test, and launch software applications
* Deploy Globally in Minutes: With just a few clicks, you can quickly deploy your application to different locations and enhance the experience of your users with reduced latency.

## Types of Cloud Computing
-  **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** - Full control of your infrastructure without the maintenance and operating costs of the servers. IaaS provides access to servers, storage, networking, and operating systems.
</br></br>
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** - In this model, you can focus on the deployment and management of your applications. PaaS eliminates the need to manage the underlying infrastructure.
</br></br>
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)** - The software is ready to be used and operated by the service provider. SaaS is also known as an end-user application.

### The Deployment Models of the Cloud

| **Private Cloud**                                                        | **Public Cloud**                                                                                         | **Hybrid Cloud**                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The deployment of resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools, is sometimes **called the private cloud** |  the cloud provider makes resources available to the public through the internet. While the resources vary depending on the provider, it usually includes storage capabilities, applications, or virtual machines. | A hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud |
|  On-premises deployment doesnâ€™t provide many of the benefits of cloud computing but is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources. |Applications in the cloud have either been created in the cloud or have been migrated from an existing infrastructure to take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing.|Keep some servers on-premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud.|


### Cloud Infrastructure vs On-Premises Infrastructure

1. **Public** - No upfront Investment, Low ongoing costs, Focus on innovation, Flexible capacity, Speed and agility, Global reach on demand
2. **Private** - Large initial purchase, Labour, patches, and upgrade cycles, System Administration, Fixed capacity, Long procurement and setup, Limited geographic regions
</br>
**What can you do in the cloud?** : Application hosting, Backup and Storage, Content delivery, Websites, Enterprise IT, Database
 


### Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. **Cost Savings**: Pay only for the computing power, storage, and other resources you use.

### Pricing of the Cloud â€“ Quick Overview

AWS follows three fundamental pricing principles based on the pay-as-you-go pricing model:

| **Fundamental**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compute**           | Pay for the compute time you consume. Examples include EC2 instance hours or Lambda invocation duration.                                                             |
| **Storage**           | Pay for the amount of data stored in the cloud. Examples include S3 storage space and EBS volume usage.                                                              |
| **Data Transfer OUT** | Pay for data transfer out of the cloud. Data transfer IN is free. This pricing structure solves the issue of expensive data transfer fees in traditional IT systems. |

### How Cloud Pricing Solves Traditional IT Cost Issues

- Traditional IT requires expensive upfront investments for hardware, maintenance, and upgrades.
- With AWS's pay-as-you-go model, you only pay for what you use, reducing overall costs.

- Provides redundancy and fault tolerance in case of a failure.
- Theyâ€™re connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking

### AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)

- Network locations that deliver content closer to end users.
- Used by services like Amazon CloudFront and AWS Global Accelerator.
- Provides low latency and improved performance for content delivery.

## AWS Shared Responsibility Model

### What is the Shared Responsibility Model?

- AWS and the customer share responsibility for security and compliance.
- Divides security tasks based on **AWS as the provider** and **customer as the user** of cloud services.

### AWS Responsibilities: **Security *of* the Cloud**

- AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all services offered in the AWS Cloud.
- Includes hardware, software, networking, and facilities:
  - **Physical security** of data centers (e.g., access control, environmental controls).
  - **Infrastructure** security, such as maintaining hypervisors, host operating systems, and network infrastructure.
  - **Global network** operations, such as DDoS protection and monitoring.

### Customer Responsibilities: **Security *in* the Cloud**

- Customers are responsible for managing and securing what they put in the cloud.
- Includes:
  - **Data protection**: Encrypt data in transit and at rest.
  - **IAM**: Control access through Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, users, and policies.
  - **OS and application configurations**: Maintain security of guest operating systems, applications, and firewall configurations.
  - **Network settings**: Manage security group rules and network access control lists (NACLs).
  - **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with regulations and standards based on data storage and usage.

### Example Responsibilities for Different AWS Services

| **Service Type**     | **AWS Responsibility**                                     | **Customer Responsibility**                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IaaS (e.g., EC2)** | Securing physical infrastructure, hypervisor, and network. | Configure and secure OS, patch management, data, and network settings. |
| **PaaS (e.g., RDS)** | Managing the database engine, backups, and patching.       | Secure data at rest and in transit, manage DB access, and IAM roles.   |
| **SaaS (e.g., S3)**  | Protecting the service's underlying infrastructure.        | Manage permissions, bucket policies, and data lifecycle rules.         |

### Summary

- AWS handles security *of* the cloud, while customers manage security *in* the cloud.
- Understanding your responsibilities helps you implement appropriate security measures for your AWS environment.
